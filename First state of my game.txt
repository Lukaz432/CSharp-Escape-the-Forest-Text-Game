You fell... The F-16 your colleague was piloting lost control. You crashed in the
middle of nowhere, in a strangely overgrown forest. Your friend is no longer with
you - the stab wound of the spear-looking branch split his heart into two.  It seems
like it's just you and never seen before plants here... Oh, and those freakish glowing
figures behind the trees. They seem to be getting closer..

One, two, three.. I'm seeing at least a dozen of them. I doubt I have a chance..

What should I do?
1. Charge fearlessly at the figures in attempt to kill them first.
2. Run the other way in attempt to lose them as you sprint.
