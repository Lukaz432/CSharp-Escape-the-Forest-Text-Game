  storyText: "You fell... The F-16 your colleague was piloting lost control. You
    crashed in the middle of nowhere, in a strangely overgrown forest. Your friend
    is no longer with\r you - the stab wound of the spear-looking branch split his
    heart into two.  It seems\r like it's just you and never seen before plants here...
    Oh, and those freakish glowing\r figures behind the trees. They seem to be getting
    closer..\r\n\r\nOne, two, three.. I'm seeing at least a dozen of them. I doubt
    I have a chance..\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n1. Charge fearlessly at the figures
    in attempt to kill them first.\r\n2. Run the other way in attempt to lose them
    as you sprint."
