  storyText: 'It smells of urine and fungi. Who on Earth lived here?! There''s plastic
    plates, clothes, food cans and a couple of cloth bags scattered around the so-called-shelter.

    

    I''m
    sure I could use them! Not sure whether I have any  time left to search any of
    the remaining tents..

    

    What  should I do?

    1. Grab the closest
    cloth bag along with the few unopened food cans and leave the camp ASAP.

    2.
    Enter in attempt to loot the remaining tents. You may find something of importance,
    but it''s risky as hell!'
