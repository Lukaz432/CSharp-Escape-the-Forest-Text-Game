  storyText: "After running for a bit you find yourself surrounded by what appears
    to be an abandoned campsite. Even though the stone fireplace doesn't seem to
    be in full swing, the smoke can be clearly seen even from a distance. You feel
    tired and hungry. \r\n\r\nDon't think I can keep pace with running this fast
    soon.\r\nThe tents must have something of value left in them!\r\n\r\nWhat should
    I do?\r\n1. Keep running further before they get to me.\r\n2. Quickly search
    one of the tents for any useful items while I have the lead."
