  storyText: 'You''ve made it. At least for now. The figures appear to have lost
    you but you''re exhausted. You must rest now. These weird looking mutated bushes
    that you just passed seems to be a source of unseen fruit.

    

    These
    do look tasty. So shiny and pink, remind me of peaches due to their softness.
    I''m not sure what these are but am sure dying to eat something!

    

    What
    Should I do?

    1. Ignore the fruit and walk further. Consuming them might
    be lethal.

    2. Eat one as you continue your march and grab a couple for
    later.'
