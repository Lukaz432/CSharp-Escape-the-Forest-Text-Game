  storyText: 'Whew, that was close! You may have heard something silently crack a
    fallen tree branch near the tent you just fled. That''''s a good sign as long
    as you don''t stop moving. But you gotta be quiet!

    

    That was too
    much for me to handle! It seems like this road splints into two. I can already
    see the shore and that would be a great spot to wait for help. Or at least hope
    build a shelter and cook a fish or two.

    

    What should I do?

    1.
    Choose the longer but safer route.

    2. Go for the quick but not so safe
    road that is overgrown by the Forest. It''s fine, the shore''s around the corner
    anyways!'
