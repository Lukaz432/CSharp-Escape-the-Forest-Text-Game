  storyText: 'It sure feels safe around here. The creatures might be scared of the
    sun, or guarded by some mysterious power of the Shadow.

    

    Anyways,
    I am not sure if there are any other survivors on the island, but I should probably
    start gathering the resources for a shelter. The help might take a while, but
    my stomach can''t take no more! Time to set up a fish trap as well.

    

    YOU
    MADE IT!!!
