  storyText: 'Dead end! There''s literally no way you are getting out of this place
    without a fight. The figure caught up to you... It could smell your fear from
    a mile away judging the way it ''s smirking at you right now. It may had been
    following your footprints the entire time!  You are not sure if it''s alone or
    not, but it''s time for the battle of your life!

    

    Well, this might
    be the end but at least one of us IS going down!

    

    What should I do?

    1.
    Fists up! I got this..

    2. Beg for mercy..'
