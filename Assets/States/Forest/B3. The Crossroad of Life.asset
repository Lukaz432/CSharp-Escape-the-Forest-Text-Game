  storyText: 'One of the creatures seems to have sensed you! There''s still around
    50 meters between you two, so you might be safe but you have to think fast!

    

    Damn,
    this is not good at all. It''s hungry for blood. And that cliff does seem deadly.
    The hell do I do now?!

    

    What should I do?

    1. Head towards the
    cliff that''s between you and the beast. You can jump into the water hoping to
    survive the jump.

    2. Fake a charge at the thing and confuse it by sprinting
    away right before hitting it.'
